Description: Graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for complete and right-censored data:
             1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests,
                which utilize the empirical distribution function for complete data 
                and are extended to handle right-censored data.
             2. Generalized chi-squared-type test, which is based on the squared 
                differences between observed and expected counts using random 
                cells with right-censored data.
             3. Graphical tools, such as probability and cumulative hazard plots, 
                to help guide decisions about the most appropriate parametric model for the data.
