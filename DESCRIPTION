Description: Graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for right-censored data:
             1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramér-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests,
                which use the empirical distribution function for complete data 
                and are extended for right-censored data.
             2. Generalized chi-squared-type test, which is based on the squared 
                differences between observed and expected counts using random 
                cells with right-censored data.
             3. A series of graphical tools such as probability or cumulative hazard 
                plots to guide the decision about the most suitable parametric model 
                for the data.
                These functions share several features as they can handle both 
                complete and right-censored data, and they provide parameter 
                estimates for the distributions under study.
