Description: Graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for right-censored data:
             1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Crámer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests
                based on the empirical distribution function for complete data and their 
                extensions  for  right-censored data. 
             2. Generalized chi-squared-type tests  based on the squared difference between 
                observed and expected counts using random cells with right-censored data.
             3. A series of graphical tools such as probability or cumulative hazard 
                plots to guide the decision about the parametric model that best
                fits the data.
